        <p>Simple and hearty dish, this is basicly a rice pilaf with meat,
             veggies, and cheese of your choice. You can substitute just
             about anything here to change the flavor up.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Yellow Onion</li>
            <li>4 cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of Butter</li>
            <li>1 cup of Jasmine Rice</li>
            <li>1 lb of Raw Meat</li>
            <li>1/2 lb of Veggies</li>
            <li>3 cups of Beef Broth</li>
            <li>4 ounces of cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of sage</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion, mince the garlic, then saute them both in 
                butter over medium heat till the onions are soft and translucent.
            </li>
            <li>While that's cooking dice the meat into small 1/2 inch pieces. Add 
                the meat to the skillet and cook it till it's opaque on both sides. <br> 
                (The meat will finish cooking during the rest of this)
            </li>
            <li>Add the rice and all the spices, as well as a salt and pepper to your taste.
                Add the Broth to the skillet and stir to combine it all.
            </li>
            <li>Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the 
                broth to come to a boil. Once it reaches a full boil, <br>turn the heat down to 
                low and let the skillet simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally,
                replacing the lid each time. Cooking the <br>rice in an excess of broth and 
                stirring occasionally as it cooks will produce a saucy rice mixture.
            </li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, the rice should be tender and saucy (if not yet tender, 
                let it continue to cook for 5 more minutes). Stir in the veggies, <br>
                replace the lid, and let it sit over medium-low heat for another 8 minutes 
                to heat the vegetables through. 
            </li>
            <li>Open the lid, add the cheese to the top, then replace the lid. Keep the lid on 
                untill the cheese starts to melt(about 3 minutes)
            </li>
        </ol>
